/*
 * voxel-io uses u8 (aka. std::uint8_t) for all I/O-related classes and operations.
 * std::byte provides an inferior alternative which does not support all integer arithmetic.
 * Proponents of std::byte arguments that bytes should not be interpreted as numeric types, but it interprets them as
 * numbers itself, as leftshifts rely on ordering bytes by their significance inside a number.
 * std::byte supports operations like << which is defined as multiplying with pow(2, shift) mod N.
 *
 * In conclusion, there is no reason to ever use std::byte.
 * It's not logically consistent and provides zero utility.
